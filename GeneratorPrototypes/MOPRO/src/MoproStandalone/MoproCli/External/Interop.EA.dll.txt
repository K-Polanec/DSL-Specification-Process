This is a placeholder for the Enterprise Architect Interop assembly.To build and use MOPRO you need to download and install Enterprise Architect from Sparx Systems (https://sparxsystems.com/). The Interop.EA.dll file is part of the Enterprise Architect installation and can typically be found in the installation directory. Once you have installed Enterprise Architect, you can reference the Interop.EA.dll in your MOPRO project to enable interaction with Enterprise Architect models.
